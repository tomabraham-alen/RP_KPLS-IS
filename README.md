# RP_KPLS-IS
This repo holds all the codes that was involved in the RP.

The code named << 40,100 linear - AKIS__final - Commented >> is the AKIS model that works on high dimensional problem which is scalable. By default it is set at 40 dimensions. The variable that holds the dimension value is << stochastic_dim >>
